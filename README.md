## Why `eksdemo`?
While creating an EKS cluster is fairly easy thanks to [`eksctl`](https://eksctl.io/), manually installing and configuring applications on EKS is complex, time consuming and error-prone. One of the most powerful feature of `eksdemo` is its extensive application catalog. An application can be installed (including dependencies) with a single command.

For example, the command: **`eksdemo install autoscaling-karpenter -c <cluster-name>`** will:
1. Create the EC2 Spot Service Linked Role (if it doesn't already exist)
2. Create the Karpenter Controller IAM Role (IRSA)
3. Create the Karpenter Node IAM Role
4. Create an SQS Queue and EventBridge rules for native Spot Termination Handling
5. Add an entry to the `aws-auth` ConfigMap for the Karpenter Node IAM Role
6. Install the Karpenter Helm Chart
7. Create default Karpenter `Provisioner` and `AWSNodeTemplate` Custom Resources

## No Magic
Application installs are:
* Transparent
    * The `--dry-run` flag prints out all the steps `eksdemo` will take to create dependencies and install the application
* Customizable
    * Each application has optional flags for common configuration options
    * The `--set` flag is available to override any settings in a Helm chart's values file 
* Managed by Helm
    * `eksdemo` embeds Helm as a library and it's used to install all applications, even those that don't have a Helm chart

## `eksdemo` vs EKS Blueprints

Both `eksdemo` and [EKS Blueprints](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/bootstrapping-clusters-with-eks-blueprints/) automate the creation of EKS clusters and install commonly used applications. Why would you use `eksdemo` for learning, testing, and demoing EKS?

| `eksdemo` | EKS Blueprints |
------------|-----------------
Use cases: learning, testing, and demoing EKS | Use cases: customers deploying to prod and non-prod environments
Kubectl-like CLI installs apps with single command | Infrastructure as Code (IaC) built on Terraform or CDK
Imperative tooling is great for iterative testing | Declarative IaC tooling is not designed for iterative testing
Used to get up and running quickly | Used to drive standards and communicate vetted architecture patterns  for utilizing EKS within customer organizations


## Install `eksdemo`

`eksdemo` is a Golang binary and releases include support for Mac, Linux and Windows running on x86 or arm64. There are two ways you can install:

* [Homebrew](#install-using-homebrew) — This is the easiest method for Mac and Linux users.
* [Manually](#install-manually) — This method is required for Windows users.

### Prerequisites

1. AWS Account with Administrator access
2. Route53 Public Hosted Zone (Optional but strongly recommended)
    1. You can update the domain registration of your existing domain (using any domain registrar) to [change the name servers for the domain to use the four Route 53 name servers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/migrate-dns-domain-inactive.html#migrate-dns-update-domain-inactive). 
    2. You can still use `eksdemo` if you don’t have a Route53 Hosted Zone. Most applications that explose an Ingress resource default to deploying a Service of type LoadBalancer if you don't use the `--ingress-host` flag and your connection to the application will be unencrypted.


### Install using Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installation method is supported for Mac and Linux. Using the Terminal, enter the following commands:

```
brew tap aws/tap
brew install eksdemo
```


## Application Catalog

`eksdemo` comes with an extensive application catalog. Each application can be installed with a single command:
**`eksdemo install <application> -c <cluster-name> [flags]`**

To install applications under a group, you can use either a space or a hyphen. For example, each of the following are valid:
**`eksdemo install ingress nginx`** or **`eksdemo install ingress-nginx`**

## Kubectl-like get commands
`eksdemo` makes it easy to view AWS resources from the command line with commands that are very similar to how `kubectl get` works. Output defaults to a table, but raw AWS API output can be viewed with `-o yaml` and `-o json` flag options.

Almost all of the command have shorthand alaises to make it easier to type. For example, `get ec2` is an alias for `get ec2-instance`. You can find the aliases using the help command, `eksdemo get ec2-instance -h`.

### Troubleshoot Homebrew Install

Note: Depending on how you originally installed `eksctl`, you may receive the error: `eksctl is already installed from homebrew/core!`  This is because `eksdemo` uses the official Weaveworks tap `weaveworks/tap` as a dependency.

If you receive the error above, run the following commands:

```
brew uninstall eksctl
brew install eksdemo
```

### Install Manually

Navigate to [Releases](https://github.com/awslabs/eksdemo/releases/latest), look under Assets and locate the binary that matches your operation system and platform. Download the file, uncompress and copy to a location of your choice that is in your path. A common location on Mac and Linux is `/usr/local/bin`. Note that `eksctl` is required and [must be installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html) as well.

### Set the AWS Region

For most `eksdemo` commands, it requires that you have configured a default AWS region or use the `--region` flag. There are 2 ways to configure a default region, either:

* Set in the the [AWS CLI Configuration file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html). On Linux and MacOS this file is located in ~/.aws/config. You can use the `aws configure` command to set the region.
* Set the [`AWS_REGION` environment variable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/environment-variables.html) to the desired default region. An example is `export AWS_REGION=us-west-2`. Unless you set the environment variable in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, you will need to set this every time you open a new terminal.

### Validate Install

To validate installation you can run the **`eksdemo version`** command and confirm you are running the latest version. The output will be similar to below:

```
» eksdemo version
eksdemo version info: cmd.Version{Version:"0.8.0", Date:"2023-06-03T17:45:05Z", Commit:"bac7ddb"}
```

To validate the AWS region is set, you can run **`eksdemo get cluster`** which will list running EKS clusters in the default region. If you don’t have any EKS clusters in the region, you will get the response: `No resources found.`

```
» eksdemo get cluster
+------------+--------+---------+---------+----------+----------+
|    Age     | Status | Cluster | Version | Platform | Endpoint |
+------------+--------+---------+---------+----------+----------+
| 3 weeks    | ACTIVE | green   |    1.26 | eks.5    | Public   |
| 20 minutes | ACTIVE | *blue   |    1.28 | eks.1    | Public   |
